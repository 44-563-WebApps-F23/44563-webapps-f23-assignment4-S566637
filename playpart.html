   <h1>Malaya Sugandhini Acts in a Play</h1>
   <h2 class="play-name">Hedda Gabler</h2>
   <p class="author-name">By Henrik Ibsen</p>

   <p class="name TESMAN">TESMAN:</p>
   <p class="speech">Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister has at last found peace.</p>

   <p class="name HEDDA">HEDDA.:</p>
   <p class="speech">I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p>

   <p class="name TESMAN">TESMAN:</p>
   <p class="speech">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of death.</p>

   <p class="name HEDDA">HEDDA:</p>
   <p class="speech">That was very kind of you.</p>

   <p class="name TESMAN">TESMAN:</p>
   <p class="speech">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p>

   <p class="name HEDDA">HEDDA:</p>
   <span class="direction">[Changing the subject.]</span><br>
   <p class="speech">She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss Tesman?</p>

   <p class="name TESMAN">TESMAN:</p>
   <p class="speech">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he not come home yet?</p>

   <p class="name HEDDA">HEDDA:</p>
   <p class="speech">No. He wrote that he might be detained. But won't you sit down?</p>

   <p class="name TESMAN">TESMAN:</p>
   <p class="speech">No thank you, my dear, dear Hedda. I should like to, but I have so much to do. I must prepare my dear one for her rest as well as I can. She shall go to her grave looking her best.</p>

   <h1>Malaya Sugandhini Acts in a Play</h1>
   <h5 style="color: green;">A Doll's House</h5>
   <p><b>By Henrik Ibsen</b></p>
   <p><b>NORA:</b>
      <br>Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little.
      This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise
   </p>
   <p><b>HELMER:</b>
      <br>Still, you know, we can’t spend money recklessly.</p>
   <p>
      <b>NORA:</b>
         <br>Yes, Torvald, we may be a wee bit more reckless now, mayn’t we? Just a
         tiny wee bit! You are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots
         of money.
         
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>HELMER.</b>
      <br>Yes, after the New Year; but then it will be a whole quarter before the
      salary is due.
   </p>
   <p>
      <b>NORA:</b>
      <br>Pooh! we can borrow until then.
   </p>
   <p>
      
      <b>HELMER:</b>
      <br>Nora! <br><p style="color: red;">[Goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear.]</p>_ The same
      little featherhead! Suppose, now, that I borrowed fifty pounds today,
      and you spent it all in the Christmas week, and then on New Year’s Eve
      a slate fell on my head and killed me, and—

      <p><b>NORA:</b>
         <br><p style= "color: red;">_[putting her hands over his mouth]_.</p>p Oh! don’t say such horrid things.
      <p>
      <b>HELMER</b> 
      <br>Still, suppose that happened,—what then?
      </p>
      
      <p><b>NORA</b>
      <br>If that were to happen, I don’t suppose I should care whether I owed money or not</p>

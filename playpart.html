        <p> <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech"> Yes, Hedda, here I am, in mourning and forlorn; for now my poor sister
            has at last found peace.</p><br>
            
           <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA.</h6> <p class="speech"> I have heard the news already, as you see. Tesman sent me a card.</p><br>

            <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">Yes, he promised me he would. But nevertheless I thought that to
                Hedda--here in the house of life--I ought myself to bring the tidings of death.</p><br>
            
            <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA.</h6> 
            <p class="speech">That was very kind of you Miss.</p><br>

            <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">Ah, Rina ought not to have left us just now. This is not the time for Hedda's house to be a house of mourning.</p><br>

            <h6 class="HEDDA">HEDDA.</h6> <p class="direction">[Changing the subject.]</p> <p class="speech">She died quite peacefully, did she not, Miss Tesman?</p><br>

            <h6 class="TESMAN">TESMAN.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, her end was so calm, so beautiful. And then she had the unspeakable
                happiness of seeing George once more--and bidding him good-bye.--Has he
                not come home yet?</p>

    In Act 1 of "A Doll's House," Nora Helmer enters the room with a joyful demeanor. She speaks to her husband, Torvald Helmer, about her excitement for the upcoming Christmas celebration. Torvald replies with affectionate words, and they engage in a conversation about their plans. As the scene unfolds, Nora's friend Mrs. Linde arrives, and the atmosphere in the room takes a turn as secrets and tensions begin to simmer.

       For example:

       [Nora enters the room, her face beaming with excitement.]

       <strong>Nora:</strong> Torvald, it's almost Christmas! I can't wait for the festivities to begin.

       <strong>Torvald:</strong> (smiling) Neither can I, my little lark. It will be a joyous celebration.

       [Mrs. Linde quietly enters, casting a shadow of intrigue over the room.]
